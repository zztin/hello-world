# hello-world
First repository on github hooray!

Hi, this is the hello-world program which greets everyone around the world whoever come across this github repository.
I am a newbie in the programing world but more than happy to engage myself in this area.
I love the nature and I hope that with the help with improvement of informatics and technologies, we can reduce our influence on environment on earth and preserved natural resource for everyone to embrance.
