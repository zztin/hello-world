# hello-world
First repository on github hooray!

Hi, this is the hello-world program which greets everyone around the world whoever come across this github repository.
I am a newbie in the programing world but more than happy to engage myself in this area.
I love the nature and I hope that with the help with improvement of informatics and technologies, we can reduce our occupation on the earth and preserved natural resource to everyone on earth and to be on earth in the future to embrance.
